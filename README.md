# üíª RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program ‚Äì India

I am participating in the **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program** organized by [**VLSI System Design (VSD)**](https://vsdiat.vlsisystemdesign.com/) under the guidance of [**Kunal Ghosh**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kunal-ghosh-vlsisystemdesign-com-28084836_india-risc-tapeout-activity-7374484798297399296-b8aG?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAeZe4ABRnXXgcvVesykjXO-9WZxOuR05PE).

This **nationwide program** is designed to train participants in the **complete SoC design flow for RISC-V based systems**, from RTL design, verification, synthesis, and physical design, all the way to **tapeout**.  

## üéØ Program Objective

By the end of the program, participants are expected to:  
- Gain hands-on experience with **EDA tools** such as Yosys, Icarus Verilog, GTKWave, and OpenLane.  
- Design, simulate, and verify **RISC-V cores and peripherals** at RTL level.  
- Learn to **synthesize, place & route, and tapeout** an SoC using industry-standard workflows.  
- Document and report weekly progress in a **structured, reproducible manner**.  
- Submit a fully functional **RISC-V SoC tapeout design** at the conclusion of the program.
